# Loan Approval Prediction

##  Project Overview
This project predicts whether a loan application will be **approved or rejected** based on applicant information.  
It is a **classification problem** in the **Finance domain**, built using Python and Machine Learning.

The goal is to practice:
- Data preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Feature encoding
- Model training
- Model evaluation using precision & recall

---

##  Objective
To build machine learning models that can accurately predict loan approval using historical loan applicant data.

---

##  Dataset
- Source: Kaggle (Loan Prediction Dataset)
- File used: `loan_data.csv`

### Features:
- Gender  
- Married  
- Dependents  
- Education  
- Self_Employed  
- ApplicantIncome  
- CoapplicantIncome  
- LoanAmount  
- Loan_Amount_Term  
- Credit_History  
- Property_Area  

### Target:
- **Loan_Status**
  - `Y` → Approved  
  - `N` → Rejected  

---

##  Machine Learning Models
The following models are used:

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Random Forest Classifier**

---

##  Evaluation Metrics
Models are evaluated using:
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-Score  

These metrics are more reliable than accuracy for loan approval problems.

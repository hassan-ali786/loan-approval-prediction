# Loan Approval Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved using classification models. It simulates real-world banking decision systems using applicant financial and demographic data.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – Loan Prediction Dataset
- Key features:
  - Applicant Income
  - Loan Amount
  - Credit History
  - Employment Status
  - Property Area

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- SciPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Methodology
- Handled missing income and loan values
- Encoded categorical features
- Performed hypothesis testing (Income vs Loan Approval)
- Trained:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Evaluated using Precision & Recall

## ✅ Results
Random Forest captured complex patterns more effectively, while Logistic Regression provided an interpretable baseline model.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Download dataset from Kaggle
2. Place `loan_train.csv` in project folder
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook
